AI Learning Roadmap is an intelligent web application that generates a visual, interactive learning map for any topic using Gemini 2.5 Flash.
Just enter a topic (e.g., “Web Development”, “Gardening”, “AI Ethics”) and the app automatically builds:
  
  - Key concepts & subtopics
  - Learning sequence
  - Summary for each node
  - Recommended resources (articles, videos, books)
  - Expandable interactive map
  - Export options (JSON & PDF)
  
Perfect for students, educators, self-learners, content creators, and developers who want structured paths instead of random Google searches.
